# Project Overview

Using real estate data gathered from a public dataset on Kaggle, our group is trying to solve a major dilemma for the average home-buyer in Michigan. 

**What will the features for upcoming houses for sale in the housing market look like?** 

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

Starting with over 2 million records, 12 columns, and 45 states in the U.S, we focused our attention on houses that have been sold in Michigan. Additionally, we transformed our data further by limiting the sale prices of houses in Michigan between $50,000 and $1,000,000 as well as removing columns that we believed to be unnecessary for our models.
