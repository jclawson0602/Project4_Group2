# Project4_Group2

**First Day Project Brainstorming (Project Proposal):**

- Using real estate data gathered from a public dataset on Kaggle, our group is trying to solve a major dilemma for the average home-buyer in Michigan. **What will the features for upcoming houses for sale in the housing market look like?**
- Starting with over 2 million records, 12 columns, and 45 states in the U.S, we focused our attention on houses for-sale in Michigan.
- Our plan to transform our data further in upcoming classes is to reduce our data even further by fields including 

- How will we create our model?
- What tools will we use?
- How will we visualize our results?
